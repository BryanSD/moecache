memcache_client is a minimal pure python client for memcached, kestrel, etc.
It is an alternative to the de facto pure python standard client
'python-memcached', but is not intended to be a drop-in replacement.

 * Minimal API
   * Only supports set, get, delete, and stats
   * Client connects to single host -- no sharding over slabs
   * INET sockets only
   * bytestring keys/values only -- no pickling/casting
 * Additional functionality
   * Timeouts via socket.settimeout() for fail fast behavior
   * Transparent retry for a few common cases
 * Pure python
   * Eventlet friendly
